## 🧐 Inspiration <a name = "inspiration"></a>

I saw a very fancy UI of weather-app from dribble, which leaded me wanting to restore the that UI with my HTML and CSS knowledge. Moreover, I also  completed the features which the UI shows as possible as I can.

## 🧐 about <a name = "about"></a>

This Weather App allows users to search the weather condition in any place around the world. In addition, I provides 7-day weather forecast and detailed current weather at that time.
This weather app is also supported on iPhone and iPad.
